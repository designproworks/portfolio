# About Me

Passionate about engineering since childhood, I joined [Designpro](https://designproworks.com) to learn and study everything about them. 
Here are some technologies I've been experiencing the last years:
- Programs: Solidworks, AutoCAD, Mastercam, Inventor, Procore, CNC Programming Machining
- Visual studio code, Photoshop
- Continuing Education: Website design, Internet and things-Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence 
- OS: Windows, Mac, Enterprise Software Database

<br />

I'm also part of the CET association, which promotes engineering science among young people.
I supervise at [Designpro](https://designproworks.com) workshop in which we introduce our passion and goal, and I also help to produce educational content on [Designpro] You tube channel every month.
